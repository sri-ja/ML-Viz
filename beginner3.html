                        So, the machine learning model uses this really fancy thing called a <a
                            href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/convolutional-neural-networks" target="_blank">Convolutional Neural
                        Network</a> in order to find out what is in the image.

                    <p>
                        Now what is a
                        convolutional neural network , woof, that's too big of a word for a small puppy like me.

            <div class="col-4">
                <img src="./img/puppy.png" class="img-fluid flip" alt="">

                <div class="bg-light text-dark rounded p-5 dialog">
                    <p>
                        Woof that's a lot of hidden layers and that's what we need to uncover

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay, what I learnt is that the model initially usually detects parts of the image and then
                        keeps working on the outputs and refining it's searches until it reaches a stage where it is
                        able to confidently say that it's a flower. So, for our scenario, the model first detects small
                        elements of the flower - things like the different petals, the stem or the center of the flower.
                        It is able to do so by comparing it with things that it can see in the pre-existing data set and
                        recognizing patterns.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next layer, the model tries to put those things together and tries to look at it from a
                        distance if we say so. So this time, instead of seeing say individual petals, the model sees
                        about a quarter of the flower or basically bigger pieces. You can think of it as pieces of a
                        puzzle coming together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our computer friend is just trying to solve that puzzle piece by piece. Now, as we further, the
                        model looks at the image as a whole - putting in more pieces of the puzzle together, until it is
                        finally able to form the image as a whole - or see the image as a whole. What the computer sees
                        in each step can be visualized through the following illustration.

                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./img/pyramid.png" alt="" class="col-md-6 ">
        </div>


        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8 p-5">
                <div class="bg-light text-dark rounded p-5 dialog">
                    <p>
                        Each step of the pyramid can be considered one step that the model uses to put the
                        pieces of the puzzle together in order to make the pretty flower and also tell us that it's a
                        pretty flower.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model isn't always 100% sure that it's is able to find the right results, so sometimes it
                        also gives percentages telling us how confident it is with what it is predictions and it might
                        give us more than one prediction. We can't really blame it though, sometimes I confuse an orange
                        for a tennis ball too.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Woof woof, I think image recognition is a really cool technology and it can help us do some
                        really cool things. I hope I helped you uncover the black box that is usually put over the
                        process and make it a little less scary for you.

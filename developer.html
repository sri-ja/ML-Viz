                        When looking at an object, there is always an optimal depth or distance from our
                        eyes, where the object is most distinct or clear - this is the point where we can just glance at
                        the object
                        and we should be able to easily recognize what it is, that is identify it.

                        For computers, using machine learning to recognize an image, it's not any different. For any
                        model, there is
                        usually a certain distance or depth where it is able to give the most accurate results or
                        predictions. This
                        distance might not be a fixed distance, as different models use different algorithms to do the
                        same task and
                        thus the distance or optimal depth also vary according to that. Our aim is to build a visualizer
                        that helps
                        the developer recognize the optimal distance.

                            We can also include features like being able to see the few best visualizations or the
                            required
                            depths that allowed the model to give responses with the highest confidence. If we are being
                            ambitious we can also put all of them together in the form of a video. At this point we can
                            also
                            delve deeper into this and build up more visualizations like a graph for example, depth or
                            distance of object versus accuracy as well, which might also end up being helpful for the
                            developer. For that, we'd need to run a depth detection algorithm for each iteration and
                            store
                            that in our array as well. The possibilities of working and improving on this visualization
                            is
                            pretty endless once implemented.

                    <p class="glass">
                        We like to believe that the visualization can be extremely helpful especially for robots like
                        me! Something like this can help me decide the optimal zoom or depth that I should maintain in
                        order to be properly able to detect objects around me so that I don't hit anything.

                        I hope you liked my idea. If you did, please don't forget to help my idea win, I'm sure my
                        developer friends would be really happy ;b
